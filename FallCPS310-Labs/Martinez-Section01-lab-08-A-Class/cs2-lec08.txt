==========

+ Review of Methods:

Do Exercise 20654 in Lecture #7 MyProgrammingLab # 20654 (chapter 6, 6.4)
Quiz-09 = MyProgrammingLab # 20657 (chapter 6, 6.4) for 10m

+ OBJECTS & CLASSES:
Chapters 9, 10

Instance Variable = regular variable (in data field of a class)
Class Variable = static variable in a class

Immutable object = the one when the contents of an object cannot be 
                   changed once the object is created

Immutable class = class where it must mark all data fields private and provide no mutator methods 
                  and no accessor methods that would return a reference to a mutable data field object.

THIS keyword (means the "current" INSTANCE/OBJECT of the given class):

Class Relationships:
-Association (two separate classes are associated through their objects, one to one, One to many, many to one and many to many: object from class A_car is driven by object from class B_driver)
-Aggregation (Has-A, a special form of Association which is a unidirectional one way relationship, a class A uses another class B in defining it: class B is used to build class A)
-Composition (Part-Of, is a restricted form of Aggregation, two are highly dependent on each other, example: Human and heart, heart don’t exist separate to a Human)
-Inheritance (A-Kind-Of, a class A inherits(gets features) from class B: A extends B)

Wrapper Classes = a class whose object wraps or contains a primitive data type. Why needed ? The primitive data types are not objects; they do not belong to any class; Sometimes, it is required to convert data types into objects

String Class
